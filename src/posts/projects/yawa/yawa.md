#Yet Another Weather App
*Work in progress*

I know, the web and the app stores are filled with different weather apps. But they make such a nice practice apps, especially for mobile!

Originally I started the project with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) but that dried out 'cause at the time I was working with RN during my 9 - 5. Now with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) being on my study plan this is the perfect way to continue with the project. Who knows if I have the time to polish this enough to publish it in the iOS/play stores.
