The goal for this project was to learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): a lightweight open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

To add some automation, I decided to use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for continuous integration. For hosting, I went with AWS s3.

The gist of the project is to provide detailed information of user's Github account, and a nice little game of who's got the biggest Github mojo!
