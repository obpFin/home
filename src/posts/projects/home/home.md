This project is, you guessed it, the site you're looking at! I got the idea when looking into Gatsby.js, I figured Gatsby would be a perfect fit for my personal page.

The only plugins I use for the site so far are for Gatsby internals creating dynamic pages from markdown files into my posts. I'll write a more comprehensive blog post of Gatsbyjs at some point.
